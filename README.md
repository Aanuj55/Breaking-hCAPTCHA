# Breaking-hCAPTCHA

This project aims to spot images containing target objects from a pool of 9 different objects
• Employed visualization, augmentation & Gaussian Noise addition techniques to pre-process the dataset
• Trained and compared VGGNet with ResNet model for multiclass classification using accuracy & recall score
• Optimized and enhanced model’s performance using stratified K-fold cross-validation & grid search method
